# Web Services Programming University Course Tasks

Welcome to my repository where I store all tasks and projects related to the Web Services Programming course I took at my university.

## About the Course

I had the honor of being in the very first batch to take  APIs as a university course. This is a very rare opportunity since not many universities offer Web Services Programming in their course work. As a matter of fact, very few universities in the world offer similar courses, hence it was so unique to have such an experience.

## Purpose of This Repository

This repository is built to show and maintain all the work done in different assignments throughout this course. This is something of a personal collection of knowledge and abilities that I have developed in API development that may be useful to other students or persons who look to learn or research this topic.
